    <h1>Overview of Mawile</h1>
    <p class="Overview">Mawile is the deciever pokémon a steel type created in generation 3. Mawile from generations 3 through 5 was generally unrecognized by most people. This was becuase it was a below average pokémon as well as usually being a version exclusive. However this all changed in generation 6. In gen 6 the fairy type was introduced giving the type to new and old pokémon. So Mawile was now steel and fairy type. Even though steel and fairy tpe is arguably the best type combination in the game it was not enough to push mawile to the top, but Mawile got one more thing in generation 6 a mega evolution. A mega evolution gave Mawile vastly improved stats along with one of the best abilities in the game huge power. Huge power doubles the attack power of the pokémon making it do double damage on all physical attacks. This made Mawile one of the best pokémon in the game at this time. Sadly in generation 8 mega evolution was taken away entirly, but despite that I still believe Mawile is very good.</p>
    <h1>My History with Mawile</h1>
    <p class="history">The first time I ever saw Mawile was in the pokémon spin off game called Poképark. When I first saw Mawile it was not all that much I just thought it was really cool looking. Then that was pretty much it until generation 6 rolled around and it got really cool, but I didn't call it my favorite pokémon untill I used it in Pokémon Omega Ruby. It was part of my team and you can't really appreciate a pokémon fully until you use it on a team. For that playthrough on it has been my favortite pokémon ever since.</p>
